        <h1>Now lets talk about how Hackers hack your computer using their passwords and Hashes.</h1> <br>
        <h2>The entire process will be documented here and I will also show you how to defend against it.</h2><br>
        <h2>So basically the Hacker needs just a Kali Linux computer (or sometimes even a <u><a style="color: blue;"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">Virtual Machine)</a> </u> </h2><br>
        <h2>Linux is sometimes considered a programmers and hackers only operating system. Which nobody knows why.</h2>
        <div class="bigfont1">
            Now Disclaimer: <br>
            The things showed/discussed from now is a real hacking technique. So even if you decide to use it on someone
            (ethically) please make sure you have explicit permission and are following all the rules.
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>So let's assume the Hacker(s) has the access to your Windows Computer, but he or she is too greedy to just
            have it once. So what will he do? Buy your computer? OF COURSE NOT. Hack it? Yes, that's what a sigma do.
            Please do not take it seriously.</p>

        <br>

        <p>So let's continue without anymore time-waste.</p>

        <p>So let's you have a password in your Windows Computer, which is a very good thing.</p>
        <p>Windows doesn't just your passwords in plain text form. </p>
        <p>It is stored in the form of something called <b class="yellow">HASH</b>. </p>
        <p>If you don't what a <b class="yellow">HASH</b> is, read this <u><a style="color: blue;"
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function"><i> Wikipedia Article </i> </u></a> </p>

        <p>For the sake of education we will assume that your password is:</p>
        <p class="yellow">Sup3rs3RETP@@$$word</p>
        <p>Which is a good password and indicated that you used some kind of password generator to generate this. Even
            then you will be hacked.</p>
        <p>After you set this password, it will be went through a hashing algorithm. Which in this case is: <br> <p class="yellow">MD4 Hashing algorithm</b> after which it will look like somebody chewed and spat out.
        </p>
        <p>After hashing the password will look something like this: <br></p>
        <p class="hash">ca0a1e55c19606f471a5b3ecf8054271</p>
        <p>So whenever you type in the password it will again go through the <b class="yellow">MD4 Hashing algorithm</b>
            and if the hashes match, you will login.</p>

        <p>This hash is what the hacker needs to get into your Computer from his.</p>
        <p>While it would not immediately tell the hacker what the hash is, it will, the hacker will crack it.</p>
        <p>Actually not entirely the hacker because he will need some softwares.</p>
        <p>Now lets talk about the process through which the Hacker will get the hash, and break into your computer.</p>
        <ul>
            <br>
            <!-- <br>
            <br> -->
            <li>Get access to your system once.</li>
            <p>He or she will need the access to your computer atleast once to get the files needed from your computer to get the hash.</p>
            <p>After getting physical access to your computer once, he will try his or her best to get the files as quickly as possible.</p>
            <br>
            <li>Get the files</li>
            <p>He will search for <b class="yellow">Resgistry Editor</b></p>
            <p>He will get the UAC prompt saying that <b class="yellow">"Do you want to allow this applcation to make changes to your system?"</b> which you might also get while installing anything on your Windows machine. On which the hacker will click yes.</p>
            <p></p>
                        </ul>
